This repository is the starting point for [HiveBox](https://devopsroadmap.io/projects/hivebox/), the end-to-end hands-on project.

You can fork this repository and start implementing the [HiveBox](https://devopsroadmap.io/projects/hivebox/) project. HiveBox project follows the same Dynamic MVP-style mindset used in the [roadmap](https://devopsroadmap.io/).

The project aims to cover the whole Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). That means each phase will cover all aspects of DevOps, such as planning, coding, containers, testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery, infrastructure, etc.

Happy DevOpsing ‚ôæÔ∏è

## Before you start

Here is a pre-start checklist:

- ‚≠ê <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DevOpsHiveHQ/dynamic-devops-roadmap">Star the **roadmap** repo</a> on GitHub for better visibility.
- ‚úâÔ∏è <a target="_blank" href="https://newsletter.devopsroadmap.io/subscribe">Join the community</a> for the project community activities, which include mentorship, job posting, online meetings, workshops, career tips and tricks, and more.
- üåê <a target="_blank" href="https://t.me/DevOpsHive/985">Join the Telegram group</a> for interactive communication.

## Preparation

- [Create GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) (if you don't have one), then [fork this repository](https://github.com/DevOpsHiveHQ/devops-hands-on-project-hivebox/fork) and start from there.
- [Create GitHub project board](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project) for this repository (use `Kanban` template).
- Each phase should be presented as a pull request against the `main` branch. Don‚Äôt push directly to the main branch!
- Document as you go. Always assume that someone else will read your project at any phase.
- You can get senseBox IDs by checking the [openSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org/) website. Use 3 senseBox IDs close to each other (you can use the following [5eba5fbad46fb8001b799786](https://opensensemap.org/explore/5eba5fbad46fb8001b799786), [5c21ff8f919bf8001adf2488](https://opensensemap.org/explore/5c21ff8f919bf8001adf2488), and [5ade1acf223bd80019a1011c](https://opensensemap.org/explore/5ade1acf223bd80019a1011c)). Just copy the IDs, you will need them in the next steps.

## Implementation

** ADD YOUR IMPLEMENTATION DOCUMENTATION HERE **

# HiveBox DevOps Project

Hi, I‚Äôm building this project as part of my journey into DevOps.

This is a beginner-friendly, step-by-step project that helps me learn real DevOps tools by building something useful: a REST API that shows environmental data for beekeepers üêù.

## What This Project Is About

- Get temperature data from **openSenseMap** sensors
- Show that data in a simple API
- Build and test everything using Git, Docker, and modern DevOps tools
- Deploy it like a real-world app over multiple phases

## My Role

I'm acting as a **DevOps engineer**:

- Using Git and GitHub to manage my code
- Writing clean, testable code
- Tracking work in a Kanban board
- Creating pull requests for each step
- Making sure the app is always easy to run, test, and improve

## Agile Methodology

I'm using **Kanban** to stay focused and avoid chaos.
I update my GitHub Project board after each task.

## Sensors Used

These are the 3 sensor IDs I‚Äôll use to get temperature data:

- `5eba5fbad46fb8001b799786`
- `5c21ff8f919bf8001adf2488`
- `5ade1acf223bd80019a1011c`

# HiveBox ‚Äì Phase 2: Version Print + Docker üê≥

This phase adds the first working version of the HiveBox app.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Built

- A Python script that prints the app version
- A `VERSION` file to manage the version number (v0.0.1)
- A Dockerfile to run the app in a container
- Simple test to confirm it's working
- Basic documentation (this file)

---

## üß† Goal

Create a minimal app that:

- Reads version from a file
- Prints it
- Runs inside a Docker container

---
